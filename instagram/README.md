Program which randomly chooses an account of instagram.

## Getting Started

1. Copy the code into your clipboard. You can just click the "Copy to Clipboard!" button
2. Then go to the instagram post with lots of comments.
3. Right click and then click on "inspect elements" or use a shorcut `CTRL + SHIFT + I`
4. On the top menu click on console.
5. Paste the code `CTRL + V`
   > Note: The code that you paste ONLY read the comments of an instagram post, no funny stuff. I said this because when you open the console Instagram will give you a message
6. Wait the code to read all the comments
7. Right click on the console, where you see a lot usernames and "save as" (you don't need to change the name)
8. Go back to the Instagram Giveaway website, click `the choose file` and upload the log file
